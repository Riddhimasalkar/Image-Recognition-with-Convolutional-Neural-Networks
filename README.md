# Image-Recognition-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
 Image recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, enabling machines to identify and classify objects within images. In this project, we aim to develop a state-of-the-art image recognition model using deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to accurately classify images across different categories.
