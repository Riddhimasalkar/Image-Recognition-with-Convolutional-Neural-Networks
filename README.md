# Image-Recognition-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
 Image recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, enabling machines to identify and classify objects within images. In this project, we aim to develop a state-of-the-art image recognition model using deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to accurately classify images across different categories.
# Image Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on image recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal of this project is to develop a robust CNN model that can accurately classify images across different categories.

## Project Overview

In this project, we leverage the power of deep learning and CNNs to build an image recognition model. We utilize the popular VGG16 pre-trained model as the base and add custom layers on top to fine-tune it for our specific classification task. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of images, and its performance is evaluated using various metrics.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/image_recognition.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code and analysis for the image recognition project. It covers data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, visualization, and model deployment.

- `data/images/`: Directory containing the image dataset used for training and evaluation. It includes subdirectories for each class/category, with labeled images stored within them.

- `models/`: Directory where the trained model will be saved.

- `requirements.txt`: File listing all the necessary dependencies required to run the project. Use this file to set up your development environment.
